# Sparta-instagram-bootstrap
Instagram Page Created with Bootstrap

## Short Introduction
The aim of this webpage was to build it from scratch using Bootstrap grid system and some other features we could find useful to add.

Personally, I used a ready-to-use theme, from which I deleted the code that was not relevant for my purpose.

### Pros
* Quicker way of building a ready-to-use webpage
* Responsive as Bootstrap practice is mobile first
* Allowed me to read all the code and the delete the right one, this is a good practice to understand what each statement stands for.

### Cons
* It may reduce the creativity for some people while coding
* Can be hard to make changes if the code is misunderstood
